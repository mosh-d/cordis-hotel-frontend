    title: "Discover Lagos Like a Local: Five Hidden Gems Around Cordis",
    caption: "Have any questions or need assistance?",
    content: "When you stay at Cordis, you're right in the heart of Lagos's most vibrant neighborhoods—yet beyond the well-trodden paths lie so many local delights. Start your morning with freshly roasted beans at Bean & Brew on Awolowo Road, where the barista knows your name by day two. Pop into Artisan Alley for handcrafted souvenirs from young Nigerian makers—think hand-woven baskets or bespoke leather notebooks. For an alfresco lunch, wander to Green Market Square, where street-side jollof rice and pepper-soy-grilled tilapia taste even better under a canopy of bougainvillea. In the afternoon, catch a sunset cocktail at Skyline Vista, a rooftop bar just a 10-minute walk from Cordis, with panoramic views of the lagoon. Finally, cap your evening at The Drum House, where live Afrobeat performances keep the energy high. These spots are where Lagos's true soul shines—explore them, and you'll leave knowing the city in a way most visitors never do."
